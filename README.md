tools , guides , and tools  for useful hacking information 

-if you want to start you will need to know the basic knowledge about what types of hackers there are 
 and they vairy from many different types for example black hat and white hack . there are many aproaches 
 note this is for educational reaslons only which will teach the basics and i do not take any responsibilities
 for what you do with the information that you are provided with below .
 
- If youâ€™re not comfortable with the basics, get more comfortable. I found it really helpful to have a good understanding of protocols like IP, TCP, and HTTP and to       take a few (web) programming courses Most of the bug bounty programs are focussed on web applications.

- To become a successful bug bounty hunter on the web, I'd suggest you check out the following resources:

- now with hacking there are various os that you can use , this is like your windows 10 or mac os . you can install these instead of windows 10 and come pre installed withload of software . the main two are ubuntu and kali linux , i dont have ,uch knowledge with ubunto so we are going to base this whole thing on kali linux . you can either install kali linix on your machine as the main os or as a sual boot or as a virtual machine , if you install it on your machine as a fresh os you will delete all exsisting files on your machine . if you install it as a dual boot this means that you will have both windows and kali linix on your machine but it will take up a good aount of space , so i would suggest using a virtual machine but i will link a video for all 3 or the options

- you can also install kali linux on a phone but you are risking deleting all apps and this means that you cannot access social media during this
